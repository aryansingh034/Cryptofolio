At the moment, only Docker-related pull requests would be accepted and merged (provided the code is safe, commit titles are sensible etc.)

Since I'm planning on basing my final year university project on Cryptofolio, all the code for the main application has to be my own to avoid any plagiarism concerns. Furthermore, as I already had a big team project for my second year, I want this to be more of a solo project that I can use an example of what I can make on my own.

Once I finish my final year, I will open the project up to being modified by the community. The only restrictions in that sense would be to not deviate too much from the original, as I ultimately do want this to still feel like my project.
